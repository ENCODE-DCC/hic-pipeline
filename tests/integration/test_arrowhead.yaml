    # We need to keep this ugly glob. Arrowhead currently can output 5000 or 10000
    # blocks depending on the number of contacts in the Hi-C map, and will change the
    # filename accordingly. For tests this is fine since the glob path is just the hash
    # of the glob pattern. If the pattern changes then this test will need to be updated
    # as well.
